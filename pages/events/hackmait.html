                organizing a 26-hour in-person hackathon with a variety of
                themes ranging from Ed-Tech, to Healthcare, and Cybersecurity.
                With HackMAIT 4.0, our aim is to foster innovation and
                creativity captured in the young minds of college students, all
                the while encouraging a focus on learning, having fun, and
                making friends.
              </p>

              <p>The event will consist of 3 rounds:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong><u>Round 1(Ideation Round):</u></strong> The
                  preliminary stage is conducted online, wherein participants
                  must present their ideas and provide a detailed project PPT
                  submission.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong><u>Round 2 (Qualifying Round):</u></strong>
                  Participants are expected to work on their projects and
                  present them to the judges/mentors during the on-campus round
                  from 9 am to 5 pm. It is not necessary to fully implement the
                  complete idea during this round.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong><u>Round 3 (Presentation Round):</u></strong> In the
                  final round, each team is required to demonstrate their
                  functional project in front of the pannel.

                <h3>Registration Guidelines</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Registration of teams must be done by all the members of the
                    team.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Teams can register under any single track mentioned in the
                    brochure/rulebook, however only one registration per team is
                    allowed.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Participation Guidelines</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    All work on a project should be done during the hackathon.
                    But the teams can plan their basic layout before the
                    hackathon. The github repository will be created during the
                    hackathon.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    During the 26-hour Hackathon, participants will be required
                    to remain on campus until 5 pm. Following this, they can
                    leave and return the next day at 9 am.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Teams can use any libraries, frameworks, or open-source code
                    in their projects. Working on a project before the event and
                    open-sourcing it for the sole purpose of using the code
                    during the event is against the spirit of the rules and is
                    not allowed.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Teams must stop hacking once the time is up. However, teams
                    are allowed to debug and make small fixes to their programs
                    after time is up. e.g. If during demoing your hack you find
                    a bug that breaks your application and the fix is only a few
                    lines of code, it's okay to fix that. Making large changes
                    or adding new features is not allowed.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Teams can be disqualified from the competition at the
                    organizers' discretion.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Mentors will be provided during the hackathon for solving
                    the doubts of participants.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    No team member is allowed to register under more than one
                    team.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Outside Delhi participants can show their presence online.
                    But participants from Delhi are required to be present at
                    the campus.

              <u><strong>Problem Statement:</strong></u>
              Develop a problem statement for the hackathon that is unique,
              unconventional, and has the potential to make a significant
              difference in society. The problem statement should not be limited
              to conventional ideas and should be creative enough to inspire
              innovative solutions that can have a positive impact on a large
              number of people.
